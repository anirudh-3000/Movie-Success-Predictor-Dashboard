1) Count of movies by runtime, vote average, genre  and countries:
We analyze distribution of movies by considering features like genre, runtime, vote average and country.

2) Number of successful and unsuccessful movies:
Shows the number of successful and unsuccessful movies. Both successful and unsuccessful movies are almost divided into equal halves, signifying that the dataset is balanced.

3) Count of success by vote average, runtime and genre:
We try to analyze how these features (vote average, runtime and genre) affect success chances (for eg: genre which has higher count of successful movies has higher chance of future success).
